 SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate simple logos for their projects as SVG files. The motivation behind this project was to create a tool that can help freelance web developers quickly create logos without the need to hire a graphic designer.

The application prompts the user to enter up to three characters for the logo text, choose a text color, select a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and provide a shape color. It then generates an SVG file with the selected shape and logo text, saving it as `logo.svg`.
